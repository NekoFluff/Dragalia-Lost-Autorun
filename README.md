# Dragalia-Lost-Autorun

*(This application is mostly obsolete given the new autorun feature provided by dragalia that allows users to automatically refill stamina and run a dungeon a preselected number of times (up to 99x)*

This python application uses a keras CNN to learn specific buttons on screen. Temporary sreenshots are taken, cut up (cropped), processed (resized), and fed into the CNN to classification. 

Decisions are made based on the outputs of the classifier, allowing the user to repeat a dungeon X times.
